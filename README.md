# PyBites for Python Features Introduced After Python3.8

Python 3.9, 3.10, and 3.11 have introduced several new features and improvements, some of which are:

Python 3.9:
- The `dict` class now retains the order of insertion of its keys, which means that iterating over a dictionary returns its keys in the order in which they were added.
- A new parser based on PEG (Parsing Expression Grammar) is now used to parse Python code, which makes the parser more reliable and easier to maintain.
- A new union operator `|` has been added to combine dictionaries and sets.
- A new type `Annotated` has been introduced to provide a way to attach metadata to function arguments and return values.

Python 3.10:
- Structural Pattern Matching (PEP 634) has been added, which allows for more expressive and concise code for conditional statements.
- Parenthesized context managers (PEP 603) have been introduced, which allows for better readability of `with` statements.
- Improved error messages have been added to make debugging easier.
- Support for more precise types has been added, including support for improved type hinting.

Python 3.11:
- The `match` statement, introduced in Python 3.10, has been improved with new functionality.
- A new operator `|>` (known as the "pipe" operator) has been added to chain function calls.
- The `zoneinfo` module has been introduced, which provides improved support for time zone handling.
- A new string method `str.removeprefix()` has been added, which allows for easier string manipulation.

Overall, these changes and improvements make Python more powerful, expressive, and easier to use, and demonstrate the language's continued evolution to meet the needs of its users.
